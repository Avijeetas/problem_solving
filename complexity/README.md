# Before Starting
Before learning any problem solving techniques(i.e. algorithms or data structures), it's necessary to have knowledge about complexities. Without having knowledge about complexity, one can't say for sure, if the algorithm he/she wrote, or the data structure he/she made, is better or not, compared to others. We'll try to explain complexity here in the easiest way possible. So, it is possible(as the way differs from most text books), it may seem informal. We are actually giving you an informal but practical introduction to complexities.

# What is complexity?
In simple words, complexity is *runtime of a computer program* or *the memory(RAM) it takes* to complete it's task completely. So, I guess, it may clear to you, what complexity actually refers to. It the complexity is lesser, then you may say, your program is performing better.

# Types of Complexity
Complexity is of two types, when it comes to solving problems using a Computer. The two kinds are:
1. Memory/Space Complexity
2. Time Complexity
